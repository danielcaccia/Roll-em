## Roll 'em

Roll 'em is a simple exercise of implementation of initial skills on Swift. It has a basic UI although fundamentals of constraints and StackViews were applied.
It's an App that randomly changes the values of the dices as the user taps the button.<br/>

Below there's a screenshot of the LaunchScreen and the main (and single) App page:
